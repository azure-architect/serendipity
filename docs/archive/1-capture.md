At the Capture folder (Stage 1), the following happens:

1. The raw text or markdown file arrives in this folder
2. The system performs minimal processing:
   - Timestamps the entry
   - Assigns a unique identifier
   - Preserves the original content exactly as submitted
   - Optionally adds basic metadata tags if provided (e.g., category, urgency)
   - Maintains the raw format without altering structure or content

The Capture folder acts as the initial intake point - a digital inbox where thoughts are stored in their original form before any processing occurs. The system simply acknowledges receipt and prepares the content for the next stage by adding the minimal metadata needed for tracking.

The goal at this stage is purely to store the thought with as little friction as possible, creating a reliable record that can be processed further in subsequent stages. No analysis, categorization, or transformation happens yet - just clean capture and preservation of the original input.

Would you like me to continue with what happens at the next stage/folder in the process?
