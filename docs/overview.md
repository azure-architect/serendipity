# The Six Stages of the Universal Thought Processing Workflow

## 1. Capture
The initial intake stage where raw thoughts are stored exactly as they occur. During this stage:
- The system preserves the original content without modification
- A timestamp and unique identifier are added
- Minimal metadata is attached (if provided)
- The goal is to create a frictionless capture process with zero barriers to entry
- No analysis, categorization, or transformation happens yet

The Capture stage acts as a digital inbox where thoughts are stored in their raw form before any processing begins. It's designed to be as low-friction as possible, ensuring ideas are preserved exactly as they first appear.

## 2. Contextualize
In this second stage, the system enriches the raw content with additional context:
- Primary categorization is applied (work/personal/recovery/etc.)
- Metadata tags are expanded based on content analysis
- The system identifies key entities, emotional tone, and urgency signals
- A brief summary is generated (1-2 sentences)
- The original content remains unchanged, but is now wrapped with contextual metadata

The Contextualize stage bridges raw capture and deeper analysis, adding just enough context to make the content processable in later stages without altering the original meaning.

## 3. Clarify
This stage begins transforming raw thoughts into more coherent structures:
- Abbreviations and incomplete thoughts are expanded into fuller expressions
- Core concepts are distinguished from supporting details
- Ambiguities and contradictions are flagged for further attention
- The system applies light editing that preserves original intent while improving clarity
- Thoughts begin to take on more structured forms with clearer hierarchies

The Clarify stage balances clarification with preserving authentic thought, avoiding premature organization while making fuzzy thoughts more precise.

## 4. Categorize
Here, the system identifies how new thoughts fit into existing knowledge frameworks:
- Thoughts are matched to existing projects, areas of focus, or collections
- The system determines if thoughts represent new territory or extend existing ideas
- Connections to relevant conceptual frameworks are established
- Emerging themes across seemingly disparate thoughts are recognized
- Multi-dimensional categorization allows thoughts to belong to multiple categories

This stage prepares thoughts for effective integration into your knowledge system by recognizing patterns and relationships.

## 5. Crystallize
At this stage, thoughts are refined into their most useful and actionable forms:
- Content is transformed into appropriate output formats based on their nature (action items, insights, questions)
- Unnecessary context or emotional content is stripped while preserving core meaning
- Information is structured according to its intended application
- Language is refined for clarity, precision, and impact
- The essence of the thought is distilled to its most potent form

The Crystallize stage optimizes thoughts for their intended use, creating a clear, actionable format without losing the valuable core meaning.

## 6. Connect
The final stage integrates processed thoughts into broader knowledge systems:
- Explicit connections to relevant entries in your knowledge base are created
- The system identifies implications across different projects and domains
- Potential next steps or areas for exploration are generated
- Bidirectional linking establishes relationships between connected thoughts
- The knowledge network becomes navigable and insightful

This stage transforms the linear workflow into a true network of interconnected ideas, ensuring insights don't just get processed and filed away but actively contribute to ongoing work and intellectual development.

Each stage builds upon the previous one, progressively refining raw thoughts into valuable, connected knowledge while preserving their authentic core.
