## Stage 3: Clarify - First-level processing

This stage involves beginning to make sense of the captured thoughts through initial processing.

### Purpose
- To expand and develop raw thoughts into more complete forms
- To identify the essential elements within captured ideas
- To highlight areas that need further development or resolution

### Key Activities
- Expand abbreviations and incomplete thoughts into fuller expressions
- Distinguish between core concepts and supporting details
- Flag ambiguities or contradictions that require further attention
- Begin transforming raw impressions into more coherent structures

### Implementation
- Apply light editing that preserves original intent while improving clarity
- Structure notes with clearer hierarchies (main points vs. details)
- Develop a system for marking unresolved elements within thoughts
- Maintain links to original captured form for reference

### Technical Considerations
- This process should balance clarification with preserving authentic thought
- Consider implementing a "questions to resolve" tracking system
- The clarifying process should avoid premature organization or categorization
- Design the workflow to handle both quick clarifications and deeper revisions
