# Initial Research Path for Identifying Underserved, Profitable Niches

Here's a systematic approach to begin your niche identification process:

## Phase 1: Market Landscape Analysis (1-2 weeks)

1. **Start with broad categories you understand**
   - Recovery/sobriety (leveraging your 10 years experience)
   - Technical documentation/systems engineering (from your professional background)
   - Expat living (based on your 11+ years overseas)

2. **Apply initial filters using DataForSEO's API**
   - Pull keywords with:
     - Monthly search volume between 1,000-10,000
     - CPC > $1.00 (indicating commercial intent)
     - Keyword difficulty score < 50
   - Code a simple Python script to process these into a ranked list

3. **Content gap analysis**
   - For each promising keyword cluster:
     - Analyze the top 10 SERP results
     - Score content comprehensiveness and quality
     - Identify topics where quality scores are low but search intent is clear

## Phase 2: Validation & Refinement (Week 3)

1. **Verify commercial potential**
   - Research affiliate programs in each potential niche
   - Check available ad rates (Ezoic/Mediavine estimates)
   - Identify potential digital product opportunities

2. **Create a scoring system** combining:
   - Traffic potential
   - Competition level
   - Monetization opportunity
   - Your personal knowledge advantage
   - Content production difficulty

3. **LLM-assisted deeper analysis** on top 3-5 candidates
   - Generate test content outlines
   - Evaluate resource requirements
   - Estimate time-to-ranking

## Phase 3: Pilot Implementation (Week 4)

1. **Select your first niche** based on scoring
2. **Create a content calendar** for initial 10 pieces
3. **Implement tracking** for both SEO and revenue metrics
4. **Publish first piece** and begin monitoring performance

This approach gives you a structured path to identify underserved niches while leveraging your unique experiences. The key advantage is that you're using data to guide decisions rather than intuition alone, significantly improving your chances of finding profitable opportunities.

Do you want to start with any particular category among your experience areas, or would you prefer to cast a wider net initially?
