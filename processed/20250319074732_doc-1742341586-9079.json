  "content": "taking the Json piece out of the Mesta\nit\u2019s full of new line characters and escape characters and I think that\u2019s necessary. I don\u2019t know why were capturing it so have a look into that. \neach agent stack puts a JSON piece and it\u2019s not four minutes I like it. I don\u2019t mind if we keep it but what are we gonna do with it? How is it helpful because each each in gesture piece is already helpful for an out gate, it\u2019s really nice so what are we? What are we doing with that? We really need it need to investigate.",
